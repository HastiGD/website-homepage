							<h2>Strengths</h2>
							<p>
								<span class="strong">Driven by my vision of the future.</span>
								As a futuristic thinker, I define the reality I want before I
								set out to create it. In the same way my immigrant family set
								their sights on a country where diversity is celebrated, I
								envision the future of tech as an inclusive space where
								homogeneity in the workplace is a relic of the past.
							</p>
							<p>
								<span class="strong">Turning thoughts into actions,</span> but
								more importantly, motivating others to do the same. Having
								always been the person to ask “when should we get started?!”,
								I’ve come to learn that gassing up my peers has led to greater
								collective accomplishments. Whether it’s personal goals or
								academic achievements, I believe it’s necessary to encourage the
								people in my tribe to level up.
							</p>
							<p>
								<span class="strong">Learn, adjust, evolve, repeat.</span> Being
								a student is not a temporary state when you have the mindset of
								a lifelong learner. My approach to daunting tasks is to make
								incremental strides, recruit feedback, shift, and try again. I
								believe my greatest strength in the face of failure is targeting
								what to do differently next iteration.
